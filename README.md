# Instagram Follower/Following Tracking
This tool allows the user to track their current followers or following list on their Instagram account by comparing it with the previous follower/following list.

The tool uses downloaded Instagram information from the owner's account without requiring any login credentials inside the code.

The user needs to have the previous follower/following list data before keeping track of the current follower/following list for any unfollowed or new Instagram users.

NOTE : PLEASE USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
